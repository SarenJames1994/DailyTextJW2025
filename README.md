# 🕊️ DailyTextJW2025 (MAY 2025)

A simple Python-powered desktop widget that displays the **Daily Text** from [JW.org](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e) each day.
 This tool was made to help me read the daily text from my work PC 😊

## ✨ Features
- 💻 Small desktop widget using Python + Tkinter
- 🔁 Includes a **refresh** button
- 📌 **Always stays on top** of other windows
- 💾 Icon shortcut with `.ico` 
- 💥 Option to **auto-start on Windows boot**

## 📁 Files Included

- `DailyText.bat` – batch launcher (for CMD)
- `DailyText.vbs` – silent launcher (no CMD popup)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Make sure Python is installed (and added to PATH).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
3. 🔧 Update the file paths in your .bat or .vbs files to match where you saved DailyText.py.
4. ✅ Double-click the .vbs file to launch quietly with no terminal box.
5. 🚀 Optional: Add a shortcut to your .vbs file into: C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup - This will launch it automatically every time you start your PC 💡


Why I Made This:
I wanted a simple, beautiful way to see the Daily Text right on my desktop — no browser tabs, no distractions. 
This has helped me make reading it part of my routine each morning.

Feel free to use, modify or share with anyone it may help! 
Much love from James (Australia)
